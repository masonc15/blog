I am a developer and security enthusiast. Writing about security and development and whatever comes to mind.
I usually work with NodeJS, Angular, MongoDB. But I really like experimenting.

Here is my really outdated website. I made it when I was learning to code, don't judge me too hard.  [xapax.github.io](https://xapax.github.io)
