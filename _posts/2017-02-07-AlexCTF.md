title: AlexCTF - Writeup
---

Me and some friends participated with our team in AlexCTF this weekend. It was a great CTF with some really fun challenges. So a big thanks to **MSP Tech Club** at **Alexandria University**. Here is a writeup for a few of them.


## Fore1: Hit the core

All that was provided for this challenge was a core-dump. A core-dump is essentially a dump of the memory as it was at a specific moment. A common tool to use for core-dumps for forensics is volatility. But it was not necessary for this challenge.

After downloading the memory dump I started to look at it with strings and xxd. I ran `xxd fore1.core` and started looking around to see if I could find something. I also ran `strings fore1.core`. Among the strings I found this:

```
cvqAeqacLtqazEigwiXobxrCrtuiTzahfFreqc{bnjrKwgk83kgd43j85ePgb_e_rwqr7fvbmHjklo3tews_hmkogooyf0vbnk0ii87Drfgh_n kiwutfb0ghk9ro987k5tfb_hjiouo087ptfcv}
```

The `{}` looked suspicious. So I started looking closer at it.

Then I noticed that the uppercase letters in the first part form the word `ALEXCTF`. So I knew that it was the right string I was working with. But I couldn't figure out the rest of it. I continued looking for uppercases, but the result from that didn't make much sense. Together with a team-mate we figured out that relevant letters were every fifth letter. So we just had to count through the string and we got the flag.

```

```





### Fore3 - USB probing

> One of our agents managed to sniff important piece of data transferred transmitted via USB, he told us that this pcap file contains all what we need to recover the data can you find it?

So we were provided with a pcap file. Not surprisingly, given the challenge description, the traffic was in protocol USB and USBMS. I had not worked with that protocol before so it really intrigued me.

I was kind of hard to find easy available information on how to analyze a USB pcap-file. But luckily the process were pretty straight forward. Each packet has a section called "Leftover Capture Data".

I sorted the pcap file and started looking at each big packet. Packet 30 look interesting at first, it contained several strings, and one said `flag.mp4`. 
But the entire file was no more than 146 kb. So it didn't seem very plausible that it actually cocntained all the files that were found in the strings.

Packet 30 contains, among other things, the following:

So I continued looking and found packet 101. The data-portion of the packet started like this:


```    
00000000: 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452  .PNG........IHDR
00000010: 0000 01cc 0000 0082 0806 0000 01bc f9c8  ................
```

So I guessed that it was an image. Then I had to research how to extract that image from the pcap file. [This](http://www.blackbytes.info/2012/01/four-ways-to-extract-files-from-pcaps/) article was helpful in finding ways to extract data from the file.


So I right-clicked on the file, on `Leftover Capture Data` and selected `Export packet byte`. And saved the data as image.png

![Wireshark]({{ site.url }}{{ site.posturl }}/assets/alexctf/the-image-flag.png)


Then I just opened the image and got the flag.

When I connected to the port I received this:

```

I connected a few times and saw that the only math we were asked to do was `+-/*%`. 

So I wrote this simple script.

```python
import socket
import sys
import time

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connect = s.connect(('195.154.53.62', 1337))

while True:
        time.sleep(1)
        banner=s.recv(1024)
        print banner
        split_banner = banner.split(" ")
        num1 = split_banner[-4].split(":")
        num1 = int(num1[1])
        num2 = int(split_banner[-2])
        type_of_math = split_banner[-3]

        if type_of_math == "*":
                answer = num1 * num2
        elif type_of_math == "+":
                answer = num1 + num2
        elif type_of_math == "-":
                answer = num1 - num2
        elif type_of_math == "%":
                answer = num1 % num2
        elif type_of_math == "/":
                answer = num1 / num2

        print answer
        answer = str(answer)
        s.send(answer + "\n\r")
s.close()
```

After solving 250 calculations I received this:

```
Flag:

Congrats MR bot!
Tell your human operator flag is: ALEXCTF{1_4M_l33t_b0t}

## RE1 - Gifted

This one was really simple. It was a binary, and all I had to do was run `strings gifted` to get the flag: `AlexCTF{Y0u_h4v3_45t0n15h1ng_futur3_1n_r3v3r5ing}`

## Conclusion

This CTF didn't have any pwn-challenges so I hope the next ctf has more of them, since I have been working on reverse engineering and pwning lately. But the forensics challenges keep growing on me. Always really fun to test them out. The category that interests me the least is probably crypto.

Together in the team we soleved a few more challanges. I made some significant progress on a few other challanges, so now I am going to check out writeups for those and see how close I was.
