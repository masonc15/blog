<h2>Installing Apache</h2>
<p>So first we are going to install Apache. Which is really easy.</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
sudo apt-get update<br />
sudo apt-get install apache2<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Yeah, it is that easy. I am running the server on a VM (that I have configured to Bridged Adapter i the network-settings) so that it can connect to my network.</p>
<p>Now I can reach the inital page create by apache at the address of the servers internal ip (that looks something like this: 192.168.1.101). The page we see is just a "Your server is working"-page by apache. You can find it and remove it, or change it in /var/www/html.</p>
<p>But it could be a bit enoying having to write out the internal IP-address every time we want to visit the servers page. So we can give it a name by changing the config file in /etc/hosts on the host-computer. </p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
sudo vim /etc/hosts<br />
#Here we just add the internal IP-address of the server, and then we make a tab (now several spaces) and then the name. Like this:<br />
192.168.1.101    mylocalhomepage.dev<br />
[/code]<br />
Now we only need to restart the network service<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And now we can view the apache-page on mylocalhomepage.dev</p>
<p>To develop with apache it can be quite annoying to always have to write sudo before writing in any file in /var/www/html.<br />
There are two ways to solve this.<br />
1. Change the permission of the dir /var/www/html.<br />
2. Change the root-directory. So that apache looks elsewhere. Let's do that.</p>
<p>Go to:<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
#Let's first make a backup in case we mess up somewhow.<br />
sudo cp 000-default.conf 000-default.conf.backup<br />
#Then we edit the file to the following:<br />
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf<br />
DocumentRoot /home/yourUsername/www<br />
[/code]<br />
This is a really strange name of the conf-file to me, but whatever. Now we need to change one more file and we are good to go.</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
#Make a copy. I like to have the original to look at if something happens.<br />
sudo cp /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.backup<br />
sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf</p>
<p>#Change this part<br />
&lt;Directory /home/yourUser/www/&gt;<br />
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks<br />
        AllowOverride None<br />
        Require all granted<br />
&lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
#Then we restart apache so the changes take effect<br />
sudo service apache2 restart<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Now you can create a file in /home/yourUser/www called index.html and you will see it if you go to localhost.<br />
I managed to ess something up and the googeling solution for a long time. </p>
<h2>Installing PHP5</h2>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Now you should be able to use apache as your server and render php-files. Create a file called index.php in your apache-root folder.</p>
<p>[code lang="html"]<br />
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
  &lt;head&gt;<br />
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;title&gt;PHP-page&lt;/title&gt;<br />
  &lt;/head&gt;<br />
  &lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>  &lt;?php<br />
    echo &quot;test if php is working&quot;;<br />
  ?&gt;</p>
<p>  &lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>The php-code should be rendered on the serverside and output "test if php is working". If the code is put in a html-comment, it means that php is not working and active. And you will have to troubleshoot it. </p>
