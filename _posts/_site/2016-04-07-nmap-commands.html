<h2>Find hosts/devices on the network</h2>
<p>nmap -sP 192.168.0.1/24<br />
To find out what devices are on the network you need to know the ip of the router.<br />
Here are some common:<br />
10.0.1.1<br />
10.0.0.2<br />
10.0.0.138<br />
192.168.0.1<br />
192.168.1.1<br />
192.168.1.10.1<br />
192.168.11.1<br />
192.168.2.1<br />
192.168.3.1<br />
192.168.1.254<br />
192.168.254.254</p>

<h2>Scan for open ports</h2>
<p>The most simple of commands to check for some standard ports is:<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
nmap 192.168.0.103<br />
[/code]<br />
But that does not check all of the possible ports.<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.0.164<br />
[/code]<br />
Or decide what ports you do want to check.</p>
<h2>Check what service uses a specific port</h2>
<p>Let's say we find some open ports. But the port is either to high to have a specific service. Or it is on a port that is not usually used for it. For example, a lot of people are moving their ssh to not be port 22 to avoid spam-attacks.<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
45061/tcp open  unknown<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So we just add the -sV flag.<br />
[code]<br />
sudo nmap -sV -p 45061 192.168.1.103<br />
[/code]</p>
