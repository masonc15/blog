<p>So recently I have had some problems Advanced Package Tool, better known as APT. The popular linux package manager.</p>
<p>I have received the following errors when I have run [code lang="bash"]sudo apt-get update[/code].</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release Unable to find expected entry 'universe/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I tried to regenerate the sources.list several times. By removing it and then running apt-get update again. I also read about a million posts on askubuntu and stack overflow.</p>
<p>In the end, the fix for me was to generate a new source.list. This is the tool I used to create a new source.list file.</p>

You then just copy-paste it and add it to /etc/apt/sources.list<br />
Then I ran [code lang="bash"]sudo apt-get update[/code]<br />
But that threw a lot of errors. So I ran, as apt suggested, [code lang="bash"]sudo apt-get update --fix-missing[/code]</p>
<p>And that fixed the whole issue, at least for now.</p>
