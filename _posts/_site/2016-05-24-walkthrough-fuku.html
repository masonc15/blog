<p>I have just finished another VM. The very annoying, but fun, machine called Fuku. As in Fuck you, I guess. It was designed to really mess with the challenger.</p>
<p>Okay, so let's get started.</p>
<p>So after scanning the machine I saw that all ports were open. But only ssh port 22 was a real service. I tried a few basic password on it, but I got blocket pretty fast. I am guessing some fail2ban serivce. The rest of the ports just outputed a FUKU note. So they were just false positives. So I wrote a python-script to try out every port possible. But that wasn't easy. First I wrote it to check for the return-length. But that didn't return anything. So that we quite annoying. And I also added multithread to be able to check the ports faster:<br />
[code]<br />
from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool<br />
pool = ThreadPool(2)<br />
results = pool.map(testPorts, minArr)<br />
[/code]<br />
SO then I had to rewrite the script to make a get-request instead. Anyhow, I found the joomla service on port 13370 after a lot of work. And I ran joomscan on it and found a lot of vulnerabilities. Especially a vulnerability that creates a admin-user for you. So I did that. Here is the exploit I used: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/6234/</p>
<p>The page was in japanese, but it wasn't that hard to create the admin-user. But once I was in it was really difficult to understand what was going on. I though I changed the language so many times. And I tried to change it. At one point I thought english had been removed completely just for the sake of FUKU. But in the end I found it.</p>
<p>Then came the next challenge. How to upload a shell. I tried to turn off all forms of editors to be able to insert php, but nothing worked. So I tried to enable ftp, but that didn't work since that port was already in use. I tried to upload a shell through the media-uploads, but that blocked the code. So after some heacy googeling on how to run php I ended up installning the DirectPhp-plugin. This one: http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/joomla/directphp-plugin.php#download</p>
<p>So I uploaded my reverse-shell and got in. </p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do was to spawn a shell: </p>
<p>[code]<br />
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;)'<br />
haha! FUKU! Only root can run that command.<br />
[/code]<br />
That together with a few other commands was blocked. And since I couldn't get a tty-shell I was unable to use sudo and su. </p>
<p>So I started to mess around with the mysql-database. Which was quite difficult without a tty-shell. It was really buggy. Oh yeah, I found the mysql-login credencials in configuration.php in /var/www/html. So I looked around in the databse fuku and found gizmos user. So I got the hash and cracked it with hashcat. </p>
<p>[code]<br />
hashcat -m 11 -a 0 -o found.txt admin.hash /usr/share/hashcat/rules/rockyou-30000.rule<br />
[/code]<br />
Only to find that gizmo used the same password to his user as for the database. sillyboy. So that was not so useful. There was also another admin-user and a admin-account in tacacs. "admin	ht70zyjHsMl3A".</p>
<p>So I transfered my enumeration-script and started enumerating. I found that it was a ubuntu-15.04 machine. So I figured to could try the standard overlay-exploits that work on quite a few ubuntus. But gcc was somehow blocked.<br />
[code]<br />
www-data@Fuku:/tmp$ gcc exp.c -o exp<br />
gcc exp.c -o exp<br />
haha! FUKU! Only root can run that command.</p>
<p>[/code]<br />
So I compiled the the exploit on my machine and then did a wget to transfer it. But it wouldn't run since www-data lacked certain rights.</p>
<p>Then I got stuck for quite some time. ANd I cheated a bit, just to read the words chrootkit. So I found that program running and I looked for an exploit for it. And found this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33899/<br />
Pretty crazy exploit. A incredible priv-esc exploit from a program that attempts to stop rootkits. So after a few trial and error with using the exploit I finally just wrote: [code]<br />
echo &quot;echo root:adminadmin | chpasswd&quot; &gt; update<br />
[/code]<br />
And then I logged in using ssh. But that was after going a bit crazy in trying to get a tty-shell for www-data. So that was it. I got root and the flag. </p>
<p>[code]<br />
Yep, this is a flag. It's worth over 9000 Internet points!<br />

<p>In the root-folder was all the programs and rools that I was blocked from using. </p>
<p>[code]<br />

[/code]</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I spent a lot of time writing the python-script. So that was a good learning-experience. Finding the chrootkit-was probably the hardest. I should have seen that it was a unusual service. All in all a really fun challenge! Thanks https://www.vulnhub.com/author/robert-winkel,190/ Robert Winkel for the machine! Frustrating but fun!</p>
