<p>Aggregate is a way to find and filter data in MongoDB.<br />
It uses a pipeline structure, so the data is requested and then pass through a number of different filters. Is is similar to piping as we do it in unix.</p>
<p>The one I have been using is $match and $group</p>
<h2>$group</h2>
<p>Group is one of the most common methods in aggregate. It takes the input data and divides it up in different buckets/sections (or whatever you like to call it).<br />
Let's say our database looks something like this:<br />
[code lang="js"]<br />
//collection-name: names<br />
{<br />
nombre: &quot;Philip&quot;<br />
},<br />
{<br />
nombre: &quot;Pelle&quot;<br />
},<br />
{<br />
nombre: &quot;Philip&quot;<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
It is just three documents with one value, nombre. So lets group these values together.</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]<br />
    names.aggregate({<br />
      $group: {<br />
        _id: {<br />
          name: &quot;$nombre&quot;<br />
        }<br />
      }<br />
    }, function(err, result){<br />
      console.log(result)<br />
    });<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This pipes the whole collection through our aggregate method. The method then groups the different $nombre-fields into different buckets. All the fields with "Philip" is grouped together in one bucket. And "Pelle" is put into it's own bucket.</p>
<p>This is not so useful though. So let's count to see how many Philip's there are, and how many Pelle. This introduces at least a little bit of functionality.</p>
<p>[code language="js"]<br />
      $group: {<br />
        _id: {<br />
          name: &quot;$nombre&quot;<br />
        },<br />
        count: {<br />
          $sum: 1<br />
        }<br />
      }<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So now we have created a bucket for each nombre-field in the documents. Now we want to count how many they are. So in the group object we create a count-key and as a value we add another object that sums it all up, adding 1 for each document. If we but 2 it is going to add two for each document. Pretty simple.<br />
So now, we are gonna get the data without any order. So let's sort it in ascending order.</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]</p>
<p>    name.aggregate({<br />
      $group: {<br />
        _id: {<br />
          name: &quot;$nombre&quot;<br />
        },<br />
        count: {<br />
          $sum: 1<br />
        }<br />
      }<br />
    },<br />
    {<br />
      $sort: {<br />
        count: -1<br />
      }<br />
    }, function(err, result){<br />
      console.log(result)<br />
    });<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Okay, so here we are saying that we want to sort the count-variable and then sort it in ascending order.</p>
<p>That's it for now.</p>
