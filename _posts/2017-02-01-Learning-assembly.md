title: Learning Assembly and Reverse Engineering
---

During the last couple of days I have been going through the course **Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration** by [Xeno Kovah](https://twitter.com/xenokovah). It is a free course and can be found [here](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html). The course contains slides, code, binaries and videos. It teaches you the basics of assembly and the basics of how to reverse engineer simple programs. It teaches you how to compile and debug programs in Visual Studio and with GDB.

I have to say that this course was really great. I have been jumping around between courses and books trying to learn assembly, but it was not until this course that I felt that things really started to come together. I really recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting started with reverse engineering or binary exploitation.


### Give me random assembly to reverse

Sometimes I feel that there are not enough exercises when you are trying to learn something new. After I have done the exercise in a course I feel like I need to do it twenty times more to really learn it. In this course I wanted to do some more exercises, but the problem was that when I wrote the code and compiled it it became a bit boring to reverse it since I already knew what it did. So instead I compiled so many tiny programs that I forgot how they were written. And then I created a simple website that hands me the code randomly to reverse engineer. I know there are other pages out the with crackmes and other stuff, but I wanted to create my own little randomizer for fun. You can find it [here](https://xapax.github.io/reveng/assem.html). I want to be able to just have a glance of the code and have a fair idea of what it does. So this is what I hope this simple little tool will do for me.
