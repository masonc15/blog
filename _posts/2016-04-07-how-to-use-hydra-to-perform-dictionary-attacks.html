<p>So I have been playing around with some vulnerable VMs (from the awesome <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com">vulnhub.com</a>. Some of them have had ftp and ssh services running on them. So I have tried to make dictionary attacks against them.</p>
<p>First we need some dictionaries with passwords. Here is a great <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords">collection of dictionaries/password-lists</a></p>
<p>This is the basic syntax. So first we add the list with usernames. Then the list of passwords. Then the ip. Then we specify the port (-s) then the service (in this case ssh). -V is for verbose mode.<br />
The -s is only needed if the service is on another port than the default.<br />
[code]<br />
hydra -L userlist.txt -P best1050.txt 192.168.1.103 -s 45061 ssh -V<br />
[/code]<br />
The man page is really quite useful.</p>
