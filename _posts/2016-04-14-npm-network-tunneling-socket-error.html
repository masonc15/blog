<p>Sometimes when I have tried to download npm-packages I have received the following error:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
npm ERR! node v4.3.1<br />
npm ERR! npm  v2.14.12<br />
npm ERR! code ECONNRESET</p>
<p>npm ERR! network tunneling socket could not be established, cause=connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080<br />
npm ERR! network This is most likely not a problem with npm itself<br />
npm ERR! network and is related to network connectivity.<br />
npm ERR! network In most cases you are behind a proxy or have bad network settings.<br />
npm ERR! network<br />
npm ERR! network If you are behind a proxy, please make sure that the<br />
npm ERR! network 'proxy' config is set properly.  See: 'npm help config'</p>

<p>Which is strange since I am not behind a proxy. I am not quite sure what the real issue here is. But I have found that a solution for it is:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
npm config set proxy false<br />
npm cache clean<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This seems to do the trick for me.</p>
