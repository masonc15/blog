<p>My notebook is a bit slow. I only have 4 gb of ram. So I want to upgrade it a bit.</p>
<p>First thing first. What do I have now?</p>
<pre>sudo dmidecode --type memory</pre>
<p>This gives us all the info we need about the current memory in out computer.</p>

<p>In the first section we can see that the maximum-capacity of this computer is 16gb of memory and that the there is space for two devices. In other words, it has two slots for memory. So I guess I can add two 8gb of memory without problem.</p>
<p>Then it lists the current memories I have installed. As you can see I only have one memory installed, on the first slot. And it appears to be a 4gb memory. What is important to note here it the type. Is says here that it is a DDR3. So my new memory must be a DDR3, if cannot be DDR2 orÂ DDR4. Motherboards are usually only able to support one memory-type.</p>
